📌 Objective:
To develop a machine learning classifier that predicts whether a semiconductor manufacturing unit will Pass (-1) or Fail (1) based on high-dimensional sensor signal data. The ultimate goal is to help engineers identify which signals most influence yield, improving efficiency and reducing cost.

📂 Dataset:
File: signal-data.csv
Samples: 1567
Features: 591 (sensor signals)
Target: Binary class - Pass (-1) or Fail (1)

🔧 Steps Completed:
*)Data Loading & Cleaning
*)Removed irrelevant and non-numeric columns (e.g., timestamps)
*)Handled missing values using median imputation
*)Exploratory Data Analysis
*)Univariate and bivariate visualizations
*)Target distribution check (class imbalance confirmed)
*)Data Preprocessing
*)Applied SMOTE to balance classes
*)Scaled data using StandardScaler
*)Split into training and testing sets
